Navigation based mobile application intended for use by new Drury students. 
The app will have general information useful to new students and several features that will utilize the student's schedule. 

Features:
-Quick access to handy resources such as FAQ's and important office contact information.
-Stay organized by entering your class schedule into the app. Dnav can hold multiple schedules, so you can also keep track of club activities, sport schedules, and more.
-Use your schedule to draw a route between classes on any given day.
-Find buildings and parking lots around Drury's campus. And when you tap on a pin, Dnav will tell you what services are housed in the building.
-Keep track of what's going on at Orientation with the Orientation FAQ.
-Need to find a certain building, parking lot, or field? Search for it by name.

Most documentation exists in the wiki, some exists in the downloads page.
